Toby is an Advisor in Google Cloud's Office of the CISO, and an outspoken advocate for change in the motion picture industry. 

While productions become increasingly decentralized and global operations, his 
emphasis is on building security into every step of the supply chain. At the same time, 
new technologies like Generative AI are completely disrupting traditional pipelines. Integrating these advances safely and frictionlessly in support of the creative process-- that is his mission.

At Google, Toby works with the largest and most innovative studios and production companies on the planet, advising on security strategy across both the content and traditional enterprise domains.

Prior to Google, Toby worked at Microsoft where he spent five years bringing industry solutions to the Azure cloud. Some of the projects he worked on there include Avid's [Edit On-demand](https://www.avid.com/press-center/avid-redefines-video-editing-with-public-launch-of-avid--edit-on-demand-cloud-subscription-service/) and [Dreamworks's cloud-based animation pipeline](https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/universal-microsoft-azure-cloud-production-1234743076/).

Before joining Microsoft: Toby built and sold a consulting agency in Seattle, oversaw the cloud and acquisition strategy for an MSP in New York, and worked as a Senior Architect at OmnicomMediaGroup.

In all his work, Toby is guided by a simple maxim: *build systems like you won't be there to support them; build relationships like you will*.
