Toby is an outspoken advocate for change in the motion picture industry. 

At a time when productions are increasingly decentralized operations, his 
emphasis is on building security into the supply chain. At the same time, 
new technologies like Generative AI are poised to completely disrupt the 
creative pipeline. Safely and frictionlessly integrating these advances
in support of the creative process-- that is his mission.
