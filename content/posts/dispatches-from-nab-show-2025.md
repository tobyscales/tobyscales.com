There's an internal meme at Google that perfectly sums up my experience at NAB last week:
{{< figure src="/images/blog/im-so-tired.png" caption="As seen on Google Memegen" class="align-center">}}

(Pretty sure that's still the most upvoted meme on the site.) 

I suppose because it covers succinctly the heady mix of uncertainty, anxiety, and depression that's known to affect Googlers tasked with "[thriving in ambiguity](https://igotanoffer.com/blogs/tech/googleyness-leadership-interview-questions)."

At NAB this year it became clear that we're all Googlers now-- our economic and democratic institutions, our relationship to the federal government, America's relationships with our allies-- all of that is now shot through with ambiguity. And in Hollywood at least, that ambiguity is starting to look a lot more like a full-blown existential crisis.

As one of my friends put it: "The year started with half our city on fire, and it hasn't gotten better!" So when people ask me about the NAB show, the only word I can come up with to describe it is: depressing. The fatigue and anxiety were pervasive in every conversation. Whether it was how productions need to get more efficient, how post-houses are starved for work, or how studios are "restructuring" the implicit question in every conversation was both "Can we keep doing this?" and "For how long?"

I sat down with Richard Atkinson at the CDSA Member's Day to discuss "The Tsunami of Change" affecting the industry, with a handful of (what I thought were) pretty good AI use-cases for any studio. But our wide-ranging discussion soon veered into the potential (inevitable?) rise of AI-generated influencers, hyper-personalized personalities able to tap into every private detail of your life to push product on you: "Hey, I know you've been grieving a lot lately. Here's some useful resources that might help. I know when I lost my mother, it really made me realize I needed to focus on taking care of myself. Have you considered a SoulCycle membership?"

(The CDSA itself is, of course, facing its own uncertain path forward. I'll share my thoughts on that in another post.)

But even in the midst of fog and uncertainty, there were good discussions. Rich and deep discussions, even. Because one thing that's true about people is that when times are good, we all put on our happy mask. It's when times are bad that we suddenly feel the urge to come clean, to get vulnerable and open up to one another.

There was a lot of that on display this year, as well. I'm personally grateful for all the people who shared their struggles with me, and for all who listened to mine. 

So I won't end this summary with a Pollyanna "change brings opportunity!" message, because that's frankly not where I'm at right now. I'm worried about the movie industry I love, the country I love and all the people I love; people whose lives are getting tossed around on this tsunami of change. 

For them, and for all of us living in this post-determinism world-- let's not be afraid to have those hard conversations, to get raw with each other and ask for what we need. AI has entered the chat, and our task now is learning how to live and work alongside this new type of machine/computer/intelligence. 

Remembering what makes us human-- and what it *feels* like to be human-- is a good place to put your time and energy. That, and learning more about agentic AI. ðŸ˜‡
