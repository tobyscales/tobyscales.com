- When should I adopt AI? _Now. Yesterday. Start tomorrow. It doesn't matter if you don't know where to put AI in your workflow yet, you need a team focused on building the muscle to manage and improve this new thing. The longer you take to start, the farther behind you will be when you finally do._
- What AI technology should I look at? _Use foundation models and coding models first. Help your devs improve their inner loop. Then expand into other operational roles-- anywhere you have to ingest documents, anyone whose job is primarily about knowing where things are-- get them an AI immediately, so it can learn from and help them._
- How should I adopt AI? _Build a Center of Excellence. Keep it incredibly small, like five people max. Staff it not with data engineers and data scientists but with outgoing, problem-solving generalists. Make sure they're people people._
- 
 question of "when should I adopt AI" is easy: now. You should start working on it now.
