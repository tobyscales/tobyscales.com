Thoughts and trends from Palm Springs this year:
 * Studios are in-housing: what's old is new again, and the [Golden Age studio system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio_system) appears poised for a comeback as the studios consider bringing more production capabilities back in-house to control costs (and manage security!)

 * "Lightweight production" was a major theme-- smaller, cross-functional teams doing more with significantly less. See: [MrBeast's 1100 cameras](https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2025/2/mrbeast-broke-an-astonishing-44-records-during-filming-for-amazons-beast-games), ETC's [8 (Pathways) project](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/thestorytellersdesk_dont-miss-the-talk-today-at-hpa-nimble-activity-7297395820214001664--Wjb) shot entirely on iPhones. 

 * The creator economy is alive and well in VFX, but with artisans bouncing from house to house how can we, as an industry, better support them? Can we figure out a way to extend the discounted rates enjoyed by the studios to individual VFX/color artists working on behalf of those studios? Or do those capabilities simply need to be brought back in house?

 * For the first time in a long time, I found myself recommending [The Phoenix Project](https://share.libbyapp.com/title/3751102), Gene Kim's seminal novelization of what a DevOps transformation looks and feels like from the inside. The specific conversation was about how to measure and improve the efficiency of production engineering-- a subject which is perenially kicked aside as the Giant Studio Machine lurches from project to project, with very little time to reflect (let alone optimize workflows). With studios in-housing, could we finally see the adoption of Agile practices in production technology?

 * Speaking of making do with less... The DPP's can't-miss annual reports on CES and their CTO Summit included what, for me, was the most insightful quote of the conference: "[Everything that makes a company work today is about harnessing people â€” and the entire SaaS ecosystem is predicated on monetizing this reality; the entities that will truly leverage AI, however, will not be the ones that replace them, but start without them.](https://stratechery.com/2025/ais-uneven-arrival/#:~:text=Everything%20that%20makes%20a%20company%20work%20today%20is%20about%20harnessing%20people%20%E2%80%94%20and%20the%20entire%20SaaS%20ecosystem%20is%20predicated%20on%20monetizing%20this%20reality%3B%20the%20entities%20that%20will%20truly%20leverage%20AI%2C%20however%2C%20will%20not%20be%20the%20ones%20that%20replace%20them%2C%20but%20start%20without%20them.)." The quote comes from Ben Thompson, and I think it perfectly encapsulates the moment Hollywood is in right now: it is in smaller companies are where AI is driving true production innovation and feats-of-scale.

**Final thoughts.** 
Throughout every session and interaction, I felt there were two different "meta conversations" happening about AI. 
 - The first was a conversation about incremental change: how to responsibly adopt AI into traditional media workflows; which models and tools were "useful" (and the inevitable segue about how to effectively measure utility); novel AI use-cases, including a "production AI" that's like part PA, part line producer and has perfect knowledge of all script and shooting changes (which can be kept on ice long after wrap, and queried during post or planning for subsequent productions; and of course SDI-to-IP type conversations about where to plug the AI cord into your existing workflow (my favorite in this genre was the MovieLabs demo, featuring an AI that filters through AI-generated images to identify only the most useful ones).

 - The second was a conversation about radical change, and topics in this bucket were: myth-busting about whether AI will replace human creativity; radically uninformed assertions about AI's impending "death spiral" due to its place in [the hype cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gartner_hype_cycle), an impending lack of training data, or [the problem of model collapse](https://nyudatascience.medium.com/overcoming-the-ai-data-crisis-a-new-solution-to-model-collapse-ddc5b382e182) when AI trains on AI-generated data; and of course lots of carting out of over-used, under-examined conventional wisdom: "the data you get out is only as good as the data you put in," "new models don't show the same performance gains as the early models," and my favorite-- "DeepSeek discovered new optimizations out of necessity." (I'll probably write a post dedicated to debunking just those bits of AI "truisms," because I hear them all the time and I think they can lead to some dangerously bad conclusions.)

But in the meantime, what I want to highlight is simply this. While there was a lot of talk about change, there was very little talk about how to actually manage through change. And this, I think, is what clear-headed individuals and organizations need to be focused on in this moment.
 
- When should I adopt AI? _Now. Yesterday. Start tomorrow. It doesn't matter if you don't know where to put AI in your workflow yet, you need a team focused on building the muscle to manage and improve this new thing. The longer you take to start, the farther behind you will be when you finally do._
- What AI technology should I look at? _Use foundation models and coding models first. Help your devs improve their inner loop. Then expand into other operational roles-- anywhere you have to ingest documents, anyone whose job is primarily about knowing where things are-- get them an AI immediately, so it can learn from and help them._
- How should I adopt AI? _Build a Center of Excellence. Keep it incredibly small, like five people max. Staff it not with data engineers and data scientists but with outgoing, problem-solving generalists. Make sure they're people people._
- 
 question of "when should I adopt AI" is easy: now. You should start working on it now. 

 * Is [Tillered](https://www.tillered.com/) the missing link between [DIT carts](https://blog.frame.io/2023/10/30/history-of-digital-imaging-technician-and-dit-cart/) and the cloud? Maybe!

 *  Why aren't [Colorfront's](https://colorfront.com/SOFTWARE) apps in the Google Cloud Marketplace? Because they're mostly on-prem! Perhaps that will change, as production continues to move out of Hollywood and into the diaspora.
