Thoughts and trends from Palm Springs this year:
 * Studios are in-housing: what's old is new again, and the [Golden Age studio system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio_system) appears poised for a comeback as the studios consider bringing more production capabilities back in-house to control costs (and manage security!)
 * The creator economy is alive and well in VFX, but with artisans bouncing from house to house how can we, the cloud players, better support them? Can we figure out a way to extend the discounted rates enjoyed by the studios to individual VFX/color artists working on behalf of those studios? Or do those capabilities need to be brought back in house?
 * Is [Tillered](https://www.tillered.com/) the missing link between [DIT carts](https://blog.frame.io/2023/10/30/history-of-digital-imaging-technician-and-dit-cart/) and the cloud? Maybe!
 *  Why aren't [Colorfront's](https://colorfront.com/SOFTWARE) apps in the Google Cloud Marketplace? Because they're mostly on-prem! Perhaps that will change, as production continues to move out of Hollywood and into the diaspora.
