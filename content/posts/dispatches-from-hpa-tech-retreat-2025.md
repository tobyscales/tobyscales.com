Thoughts and trends from Palm Springs this year:
 * Studios are in-housing: what's old is new again, and the [Golden Age studio system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio_system) appears poised for a comeback as the studios consider bringing more production capabilities back in-house to control costs (and manage security!)

 * "Lightweight production" was a major theme-- smaller, cross-functional teams doing more with significantly less. See: [MrBeast's 1100 cameras](https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2025/2/mrbeast-broke-an-astonishing-44-records-during-filming-for-amazons-beast-games), ETC's [8 (Pathways) project](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/thestorytellersdesk_dont-miss-the-talk-today-at-hpa-nimble-activity-7297395820214001664--Wjb) shot entirely on iPhones. 

 * The creator economy is alive and well in VFX, but with artisans bouncing from house to house how can we, as an industry, better support them? Can we figure out a way to extend the discounted rates enjoyed by the studios to individual VFX/color artists working on behalf of those studios? Or do those capabilities simply need to be brought back in house?

 * For the first time in a long time, I found myself recommending [The Phoenix Project](https://share.libbyapp.com/title/3751102), Gene Kim's seminal novelization of what a DevOps transformation looks and feels like from the inside. The specific conversation was about how to measure and improve the efficiency of production engineering-- a subject which is perenially kicked aside as the Giant Studio Machine lurches from project to project, with very little time to reflect (let alone optimize workflows). With studios in-housing, could we finally see the adoption of Agile practices in production technology?

 * Speaking of making do with less... The DPP's can't-miss annual reports on CES and their CTO Summit included what, for me, was the most insightful quote of the conference: "[Everything that makes a company work today is about harnessing people â€” and the entire SaaS ecosystem is predicated on monetizing this reality; the entities that will truly leverage AI, however, will not be the ones that replace them, but start without them.](https://stratechery.com/2025/ais-uneven-arrival/#:~:text=Everything%20that%20makes%20a%20company%20work%20today%20is%20about%20harnessing%20people%20%E2%80%94%20and%20the%20entire%20SaaS%20ecosystem%20is%20predicated%20on%20monetizing%20this%20reality%3B%20the%20entities%20that%20will%20truly%20leverage%20AI%2C%20however%2C%20will%20not%20be%20the%20ones%20that%20replace%20them%2C%20but%20start%20without%20them.)." The quote comes from Ben Thompson, and I think it perfectly encapsulates the moment Hollywood is in right now: it is in smaller companies are where AI is driving true production innovation and feats-of-scale.

What

 * Is [Tillered](https://www.tillered.com/) the missing link between [DIT carts](https://blog.frame.io/2023/10/30/history-of-digital-imaging-technician-and-dit-cart/) and the cloud? Maybe!

 *  Why aren't [Colorfront's](https://colorfront.com/SOFTWARE) apps in the Google Cloud Marketplace? Because they're mostly on-prem! Perhaps that will change, as production continues to move out of Hollywood and into the diaspora.
